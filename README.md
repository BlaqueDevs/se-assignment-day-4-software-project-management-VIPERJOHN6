ANSWERS: 
1. Timely delivery is crucial in software project management because it helps maintain stakeholder trust, meet business goals, and avoid delays that can lead to increased costs. Project managers can ensure deadlines are met by having clear timelines, setting realistic goals, regularly monitoring progress, and addressing potential roadblocks early.

2. Effective cost control is essential for staying within budget and ensuring a software project’s financial success. To prevent budget overruns, project managers can track expenditures regularly, identify risks early, prioritize features based on their value, and adjust resources or scope as needed to stay on track.

3. Agile and Waterfall are two different approaches to software development. Agile is iterative, flexible, and focuses on continuous feedback, making it ideal for projects with changing requirements. Waterfall, on the other hand, follows a sequential and structured process, which is better for projects with fixed, well-defined requirements. Agile's advantage is flexibility, but its disadvantage is potential lack of predictability; Waterfall's advantage is predictability, but its disadvantage is rigidity.

4. Agile is often more beneficial for projects where requirements evolve or need regular customer feedback, like mobile app development or SaaS products. Waterfall is more suitable for projects with clear and fixed requirements, such as building a bridge or a regulatory system where changes are rare and planning is crucial.

5. Quality assurance ensures that the software meets the required standards and works as expected. Methods like automated testing, code reviews, and continuous integration help maintain high quality throughout development. High standards are crucial for user satisfaction, reducing costly post-launch fixes, and ensuring software reliability.

6. Defining the project scope helps clarify goals, deliverables, and constraints, which sets expectations from the start. A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a tool that divides the project into smaller, manageable tasks, making it easier to plan, schedule, and track progress. It’s useful for organizing complex projects and ensuring nothing is overlooked.

7. Developing a detailed project schedule helps allocate resources efficiently and ensures deadlines are met. Gantt charts are an excellent tool for visualizing the project timeline, showing which tasks are dependent on others, and allowing teams to track progress against deadlines, ensuring better coordination.

8. The core issues your software addresses should focus on problems your target audience faces. These issues are significant because they determine the software's value in solving real-world challenges. Whether it's improving productivity, saving time, or reducing costs, addressing these problems makes your software relevant and impactful.

9. Clearly defining the problem ensures that the software is developed with a clear purpose in mind. It helps focus the team’s efforts, define the features needed, and avoid scope creep. The more precisely the problem is articulated, the more effectively the solution can be tailored to meet user needs.

10. To describe your software succinctly, focus on its core benefits and how it solves user problems. You don’t need to dive into technical details, but instead highlight its functionality, user-friendliness, and the impact it will have, such as improving efficiency or enhancing the user experience.

11. The main features of your software should emphasize what sets it apart from competitors. Whether it’s unique functionality, ease of use, scalability, or performance, these features help position your software as a valuable tool in the market, addressing needs that others might not.

12. Data about market size and growth potential helps you understand how large the opportunity is and whether the market is expanding. Researching trends, customer demographics, and the competition gives valuable insights into the demand for your software and the long-term sustainability of your business.

13. Understanding market trends informs your software’s positioning by aligning your product with the needs of the target audience. This could involve responding to technological shifts, user preferences, or regulatory changes, which helps ensure the software remains relevant and competitive in a fast-changing environment.
